====== 6. Modifying the Word class ======
Created Sunday 03 January 2021

We just need an image. 
* One idea is to store the image as a file, but this is not a good idea because our code is not stored as is after installing the app.
* Even if this was possible it would be inefficient in terms of space. It is better if we use a reference.
* The correct approach is to store the image's resource_name. It is just an ''Integer'' so it is very easy to work with.
{{./pasted_image.png}}zxcb

=== Changes to the code ===
* ''private Integer image''
* ''public Integer getImageResourceId()''
* Add, not replace the constructor. We are doing this because phrases have no image. So it is better not to mention images while working with them.
