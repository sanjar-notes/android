# 7. Modifying WordAdapter class
Created Sunday 03 January 2021


* We need to add code for adding the resourceId to the ``ImageView`` in the ``list_item``.

But remember that PhrasesActivity has ``Word``(s) which don't have an image.
As the mImageResourceId is a field and not a local variable, this is not an error In Java: it is initialized to ``null``.
