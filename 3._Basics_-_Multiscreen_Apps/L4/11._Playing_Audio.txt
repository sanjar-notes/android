====== 11. Playing Audio ======
Created Wednesday 06 January 2021

As we are learning a new language, it is crucial to learn the correct prounounciation. We'll add audio to buttons to make this happen.

**For this task, we'll research and come up with a solution on our own.**

=== Approach 1 ===
The Android multimedia framework includes support for playing a variety of common media types like audio, video and images. It can do so from media files stored in application's raw resources (''res/res''), from files in the filesystem, or from a data stream arriving over a network connection.

The [[https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer#mediaplayer|MediaPlayer]] class is used for media playback.
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(context, R.raw.sound_file_1);
mp.start(); // Audio 

// Other methods
mp.isPlaying();
mp.stop();
}}}


Note: [[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager|AudioManager]] class is for managing audio volume, bluetooth etc. It does not play audio per se.

=== Approach 2 ===
Using the AudioManager class
