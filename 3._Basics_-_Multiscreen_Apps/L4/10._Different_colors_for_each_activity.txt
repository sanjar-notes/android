====== 10. Different colors for each activity ======
Created Tuesday 05 January 2021

We have hardcoded orange as the color for each background.
{{../9._Visual_Polish/pasted_image001.png}}

We'll need to dynamically set background color. 
The question is: where should we store the background color information as a variable? And why?
* Word - not good. We'll store many copies and will have to change WordAdapter too, because Word cannot change background of the ListView. ''Memory wastage.''
* WordAdapter - Good, we can change the inner LinearLayout's background and can work with just a single variable. **We edit only one file here. Reduces the impact of change.**
* Category Activity files - Bad, we'd have to store all colors in the MainActivity and send the color through the intent. It would require an **if condition**. Also as the category_activity has a fixed color which no one uses, it is best to keep the color in the category_activity itself. **Definitely not scalable.**

**We'll change the WordAdapter.**

Note: Realize that we are storing all colors(hex codes) in resources. This is not the 'storing' we are talking of here. We are storing color in the category_activity to avoid an if conditional. Storing hex values in XML or hardcoding(in this case) them is not so different.

=== Doing it ===
We are using the two param constructor for the WordAdapter, so we'll just change that. This is okay for such a small project.

**Important**: 
* ''View.setBackgroundResource()'' and ''View.setBackgroundColor()'' are two different things, where the second takes in a color object.
* Color objects can be created using ''Color.parseColor("#e7eecc")''
