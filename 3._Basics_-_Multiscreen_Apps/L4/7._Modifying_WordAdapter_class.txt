====== 7. Modifying WordAdapter class ======
Created Sunday 03 January 2021

* We need to add code for adding the resourceId to the ''ImageView'' in the ''list_item''.
But remember that PhrasesActivity has ''Word''(s) which don't have an image.
As the mImageResourceId is a field and not a local variable, this is not an error In Java: it is initialized to ''null''.
