Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this course so far. 
You will be making a class to represent a report card.
The goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow 
a school to store a student’s gradesfor a particular year. 
This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.

Why this project?
Custom classes are critical to every object-oriented program you will build going forward.
It is vital to be able to think about how to design objects which interact with each other and model real-world concepts.

What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

'''
* ''Designing a custom class''
* ''Creating that class in Java code.''
* ''Storing information in an array''
* ''Looping through an array''
