====== 12. Why use interfaces ======
Created Monday 23 November 2020

The Android team had this in mind:
1. Developers would want to customize event behavior.
2. The Team had to standardize how events work in Android.
3. Java didn't allow lambdas at the time.
4. Only views trigger events.

SAM interfaces in the View class solved all problems.
