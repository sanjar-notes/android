====== 4. Gradle files ======
Created Friday 20 November 2020

* Gradle is used for building the app, before it can be run.
* When someone else's project is imported, it may require a different SDK version and build tools. All this information is present in the **build.gradle **file.
* Most important parameters in the build.gradle include:
	1. compileSdkVersion
	2. buildToolsVersion
	3. targetSdkVersion
	4. Dependencies
* Obsolete things are crossed-out or highlighted in yellow.
