====== 8. Implicit vs Explicit Intents ======
Created Saturday 21 November 2020

There are two types of Intents:
1. **Implicit Intent** - Create an implicit intent if you don't care which app component handles the intent, as long as they do it right.
	* The OS automatically(by searching the Intent filter database) chooses the app component w.r.t the action and data(optional) provided in the intent.
	* The OS provides a disambiguation option if multiple apps are capable.

	* Structure of an implicit intent
	{{./pasted_image004.png?width=400}}

* Code for implicit Intent
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_DIAL, Uri.parse("https://www.vogella.com/"));
if(i.resolveActivity(getPacketManager())!=null)
	startActivity(i);
}}}

 
2. **Explicit Intent** - If you explicitly know the component that must handle the intent.
	* Explicit intents are typically used within an app as Activity files are directly accessible to the app developer.
	* We should almost never use explicit intents for 3rd party apps, since the app may not be installed.

	* Structure of an explicit intent.
	{{./pasted_image005.png?width=600}}
	* Code for explicit Intents		
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
Intent i = new Intent(this, ActivityTwo.class);
startActivity(i);
}}}

==== Similarities between implict and explicit Intents ====
* Both change the screen
* Both can have extras(key, pair)
