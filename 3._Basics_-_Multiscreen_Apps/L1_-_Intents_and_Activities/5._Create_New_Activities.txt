====== 5. Create New Activities ======
Created Friday 20 November 2020

* We can think of an Activity as a single screen in our app. This is not always true, but the simplification is good for now.
* In the Just Java app, we sent an Intent to open the email app. Does this means that Intents are always made across apps: No, Intents can also be used within an app, especially for multi-activity apps.
* We'll send Intents to run other Activities in the same app.
* This provides a consistent way to communicate between parts of an app.
