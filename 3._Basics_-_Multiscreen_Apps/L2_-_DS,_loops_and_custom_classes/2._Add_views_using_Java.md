# 2. Add views using Java
Created Wednesday 25 November 2020

Example of adding views inside a view using Java.
Assumption - R.id.root_view is a vertical linear layout. It is also the root view.
	LinearLayout rootView = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.root_view);
	for(int i=0; i<words.size(); i++)
	{
		TextView tv = new TextView(this);
		tv.setText(words[i]);
		rootView.addView(tv);
	}

Note:

* We need to give all views a context, which is used to apply attributes to the view, given by it's parent, children etc.
