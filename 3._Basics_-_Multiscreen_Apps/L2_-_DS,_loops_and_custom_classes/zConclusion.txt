=== An example of bad design ===
Suppose this is out root view
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
We write code which accesses the children
{{./pasted_image.png}}

Now, suppose we change the layout file to to this.
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
The code just doesn't work.

**Why did this happen?**
This happened because we assumed views would never change, which is a bad assumption. This caused our code to be tightly coupled.

**What's a correct way then?**
Use ids. But keep in mind that ids usually couple code more. In this case the code was even more coupled.
