====== 9. Custom Adapter - Concept ======
Created Tuesday 22 December 2020

Since the ''ArrayAdapter'' doesn't know how to work with the ''Word'' class, we need to create our own adapter(called WordAdapter), i.e subclass from the ''ArrayAdapter'' class and override the ''getView'' method.

The ListView is like the surgeon and the adapter is like the surgical technician.

Because we want to handle ''Word'' only, we remove the generic argument and subclass ''ArrayAdapter<Word>''. Here's the [[../../_ud839_Miwok/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/miwok/WordAdapter.java|code]].
