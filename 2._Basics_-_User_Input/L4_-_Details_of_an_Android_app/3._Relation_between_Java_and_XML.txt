====== 3. Relation between Java and XML ======
Created Tuesday 03 November 2020

How do Java and XML work together to create an app experience.
* When the app is run, some initialization takes place and the MainActivity.java file is run.
* Its onCreate function accesses the layout from the activity_layout.xml file.
* This XML file is parsed and a hierarchy tree is created in memory.
* The tree is rendered on the display.
* The nodes of the tree consist of objects called views, and they can be manipulated by the Java file. These objects have attributes which can be manipulated using their functions.

All views are objects.
