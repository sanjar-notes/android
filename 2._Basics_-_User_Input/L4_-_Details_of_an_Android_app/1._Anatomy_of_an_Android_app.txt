====== 1. Anatomy of an Android app ======
Created Monday 02 November 2020

An Android app is made of two kinds of things:
1. Resources - layout, strings, styles - all in XML. Resources also include music, videos, images etc. **Anything which is fixed(hardcorded)**.
2. Java code - the logic.

Why is it this way:
1. Separation of concerns - Code is orgarnized and can be worked on by multiple people.
2. Adaptability - We can use the same logic files but provide different resources for different devices/locales(w.r.t size, type, region etc).
