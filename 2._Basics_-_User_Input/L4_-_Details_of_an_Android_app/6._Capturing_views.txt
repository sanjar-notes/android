====== 6. Capturing views ======
Created Tuesday 03 November 2020

In Android we can capture elements(views) from an activity to manipulate them.
This is done mostly using the ''findViewById'' method.
* findViewById is the method which takes the id(an int actually) as argument.
* Returns a View object. A type cast is necessary if you wish to work with the View.
* This view can now be manipulated, and the changes can be seen on the device screen.
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
(TextView) findViewById(R.layout.textView1);	// explicit cast is required
}}}

Example:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
{{./pasted_image.png}}

Note
* ''findViewById'' is context specific. By default it searches for views only in the current activity.
* It can also be used for capturing children views.
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
myViewGroup.findViewById();  // this is a view specific capture
}}}


Q. How can findViewById work for both an activity and a view?
R. Because it is implemented seperately in both ''View.java'' and ''AppCompatActivity.java''.
