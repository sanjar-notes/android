====== 2. Resources ======
Created Tuesday 03 November 2020

* Resources are put in different folders based only on two [[https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources#ResourceTypes|criteria]]:
	1. Resource type - string, style, image, icon, audio etc.
	2. Quality - mdpi images, hdpi images etc.

=== Readying resources ===
* When we build our app, a tool called **aapt** generates a class file called R(a file named ''R.java''), which contains resource IDs(i.e names) for all resources in the project folder.
* The **aapt **also creates various subclasses of resources based on ''type'' only like icons(drawable), styles, strings, colors etc. We don't need to specify quality, the OS handles it.
* This way we don't have to interact directly with the file system for resources, which is often problematic. The ''R'' class provides a systematic and dependable way to access all our resources.

Note:
* Non-media resources like styles, strings are specified in XML files. See [[L5 - More details:8. Styles|this]].

=== Accessing resources ===
1. In Java - ''R.string.hello'' - string named hello
2. In XML - ''@string/hello''

Note: In the Java code, all resource_id(s) are actually just integers(assigned values by AAPT). This makes it very easy to work with resources.
--------------------
The onCreate function is an important function in our app, which accesses the main layout file

Another example is accessing buttons/textviews etc
