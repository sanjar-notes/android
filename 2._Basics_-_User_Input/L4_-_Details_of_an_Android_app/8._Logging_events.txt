====== 8. Logging events ======
Created Tuesday 03 November 2020

* Logcat is a CLI tool which dumps messages when an app is run.
* It is widely used for debugging Android apps.
* The Android logging system has a fixed set of buffers which write to Logcat. Some important ones are:
		1. main - the app
		2. system - the Android OS
		3. crash - stores crash logs
--------------------

==== Anatomy of a log ====
A log statement has 3 parts:
1. **Priority level** - 6 options.
	0. **''Log.wtf''** - Fatal - An error that causes tha app to close in order to preserve data. Needs immediate investigation.
	1. **''Log.e''** - Error - This is for when bad stuff happens. Used in places like inside a catch clause. You know that an error has occurred and therefore you're logging an error.
	2. **''Log.w''** - Warning - Some shady stuff going on, but recoverable. Non-normal execution. e.g Retrying an operation, missing secondary data, slow connection etc.
	3. **''Log.i''** - Information - Basically use it to report successes. Present in production code too.
	4. **''Log.d''** - Debug - For debugging. To track program flow, variable values etc.
	5. **''Log.v''** - Verbose - Print anything here.
2. A **tag** - location of the log statement - a String.
3. A **message** - the what - a String.

* Log statement are present in Java/Kotlin files only.
--------------------
**Syntax - ''Log.i(String tag, String message);''**
{{{code: lang="java" linenumbers="True"
Log.i("Button", "button clicked.."); // priority is the function. Location and message are arguments.

Log.i("MyActivity", "MyClass.getView() â€” get item number " + position);
}}}
