====== 9. Themes ======
Created Thursday 05 November 2020

Style - styles a view
Theme - styles all views in an activity
* Android OS provides some basic themes out-of-the-box
* Material themes is an open source theme resource.
--------------------
**How are themes used**
1. Download and place the theme XML files
2. Add them as parent to the style tags -  All styles will now inherit from the Theme styles.

For old versions of Android we need to use the support library, viz Theme.AppCompat.Light themes.
