# 2. Code
Created Saturday 02 January 2021


* All the project code is available online.
* All projects are git repos. But repos aren't accessible always, viz MEGAsync and Dropbox don't work well with repos. So repos(.git folder) may not be available directly from notes.



* So I stored all repos at GitHub. Here's the link to all repos - <https://github.com/android-repo-sink>
