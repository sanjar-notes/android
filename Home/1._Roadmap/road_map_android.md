2016 - Kotlin can be used unofficiall7
2017 - Kotlin support added offcially
2018 - Kotlin use encouraged by Google

We must know Java, but apps must be made in Kotlin only.
All new code is written in Kotlin
Zomato - codebase is 85% Java
Target - 85% Kotlin

* Java is required, but Kotlin is used.
* New apps are written in Kotlin

OOP - Interface, function overriden, callbacks, Lambdas, Generics, Java Collection

Android things

Components - Activities(foreground), Services(background), Broadcast Recievers(OS events), Content Providers(Rarely used in SDE 2)
* There's no void main()

Android is UI driven, not procedure one

# Chapter 1 - 2 weeks

    Activities - What is it, how is done?
    Layouts - UI elements
    View Elements - text view, buttons, Edit text, image view

    Intents - Implicit, explicit - share and select apps. App to app communication

# Chapter 2 - 4 weeks

    Complex UI - List view(infinite scrolls), recycler view, Dialogs, Toast(like subs), sheets,
        Drawyers, View Pagershorizontal buttons to change sections
    Everything here is implemented using fragments(lightweight activities)

# Chapter 3 - 2 weeks + 3w(project, mandatory)

    Network Facilities, HTTP dict, Square OK HTTP(img, http request/response), Square Retrofit(REST API), Apollo Android(GraphQL), Glide(image)
    Gradle - how to add libraries

We are ready to make apps, realworld.io - clone of Medium, using imgur API and make insta stories clone, daily notes/diary

# Chapter 4 - 2 weeks

    Media - play audio, play in background(using services), Video using Exoplayer, Camera(take photo, record videos - this is difficult)

# Chapter 5 - 2 weeks

    Very important
    Android Jetpack - toolkit to write Android apps, MVVM(architecture for building models), Work manager, Job-scheduler
    Saving data - SQLite using Room(which is an ORM - start with this after learning SQL), CameraX

# Deploy/Production - 3

    Firebase - User Auth, Notifications, Data Sync, Cloud

We can make an end to end app.

# Advanced Stuff - useful for >= SDE2

Kotlin has something - corountines (1 weeks)
Rx Java - (2 weeks)
Dependency Injection - Koin(2 weeks) and Dagger(2 weeks)
Jetpack Compose - for UI (4 weeks)

# After SDE2 - for futureproofing

* Flutter(not ignorable and not the future)
* Native iOS(mental models can be used)
