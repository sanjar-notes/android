* There is a problem when we use **px** unit: it size of elements depends on the screen resolution.
* dp solves this problem - making all the elements of the **same physical** dimensions.


#### dp → Density independent pixel

* Touch targets must be atleast 48 dp by 48dp. i.e around 9mm x 9 mm


*****


* Each view must have width and height specified.
