====== 1. View groups ======
Created Saturday 24 October 2020

* A view group just a view. 
* It is supposed to be the container for other views.
* It is invisible and rectangular, just like any other view.

* View groups are also called parent views.
* A view group can control the children inside it, using some rules.
--------------------
There are two types of view groups:
1. **LinearLayout** - Children views are arranged as an array(i.e as rows or columns).
	{{./pasted_image001.png?width=200}}  {{./pasted_image002.png?width=200}}
2. **RelativeLayout** - Children are arranged with respect to the parent and/or siblings.
	{{./pasted_image003.png?width=200}} {{./pasted_image004.png?width=200}}
--------------------

=== XML Syntax for LinearLayout ===
{{{code: lang="xml" linenumbers="True"
<LinearLayout
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <TextView
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:text="Guest List" />
    <TextView android:text="Kunal" />
<LinearLayout />
}}}

Note - In this picture, background colors have been added for clarity, code for them is actually absent.
--------------------
* View groups are have an explicit closing bracket, because they have the child views as content.
* The mode for LinearLayout is set using ''orientation'' = ''vertical'' or ''horizontal''(the default).
