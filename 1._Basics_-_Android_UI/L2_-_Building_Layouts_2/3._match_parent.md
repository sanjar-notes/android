# 3. match parent
Created Saturday 24 October 2020

For setting dimensions, we have seen fixed(i.e explicit) and ``wrap_content``(wrap tightly around the content).
There is another size value, called ``match_parent``**.**

* It sets the size equal to the width/height of the parent. i.e Child stretches to match parent's width/height.

* When we use this value, the **succeeding** elements(which are non-match_parent) are pushed out of the screen(if the dimension is tha same as orientation of siblings).
* This value does not affect preceding *elements*.
